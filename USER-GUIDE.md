# HEXR Window Tester — how to use it

A Windows app for checking a HEXR glove and feeling what it can do. Connect a
glove, drive any finger, and see what the hardware reports back. No code, no
Unity, no SDK.

Use it to answer three kinds of question:

- **Does this glove work?** Run the Quick test and read the verdicts.
- **What does this setting feel like?** Drive a channel and put your hand in it.
- **Why is this one weak?** Watch the live pressure while it fires.

> **This is a test tool, not a runtime.** It is for checking hardware and
> feeling effects by hand. To *build* something with HEXR you integrate the
> `com.microtube.hexr` Unity package or the Python library — the glove does not
> need this app to work with your application.

## Install

Download **`HexR-Window-Tester-Setup.exe`** from the
[latest release](https://github.com/MicrotubeTechnologies/HexR-Window-Tester/releases/latest)
and run it.

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- Bluetooth Low Energy — built into most laptops, or any USB BLE dongle
- Installs for you only. It never asks for an administrator password.

**Windows will warn you the first time.** The build is not code signed, so
SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"*. Choose **More info → Run
anyway**. Nothing is wrong; an unsigned installer simply has no certificate for
Windows to check.

You get a **HEXR Window Tester** icon on your desktop and in the Start menu.

## Before you start

You need the glove and its arm module, charged.

1. Attach the glove to the arm module — the connector is magnetic and guides
   itself in. **Left glove to left module, right to right.** If the connector
   pushes back at you, you have mismatched sides; the magnets are reversed
   between hands on purpose so you cannot connect the wrong pair.
2. Strap the arm module to your wrist.
3. **Press and hold** the power button on the arm module until the light comes
   on. Green is fully charged, blue is between 30% and 90%, red means swap or
   charge the pack.

You do **not** pair the glove in Windows Bluetooth settings. Leave those alone
— the app makes its own connection.

## 01 · Connect

Press **Scan for gloves**. Gloves appear as `HaptGloveAR Left` or
`HaptGloveAR Right`, and the app reads which hand it is from that name.

Press **Connect** on the row you want. A card appears below showing the hand,
the battery level and the address.

You can connect **both gloves at once**. They are separate devices and
everything after this treats them separately.

**Nothing found?** The arm module is probably not switched on — press and hold
the power button and scan again. If the status says *Bluetooth unavailable*,
that is your PC's adapter, not the glove.

## 02 · Test

This is where you feel things.

**Pick a hand.** Left, right, or both. A glove that is not connected cannot be
selected.

**Pick channels.** Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky and Palm are the six
things a HEXR glove can drive. Use **Select all** for all six or **None** to
clear them.

**Pick a mode:**

| Mode | What it feels like |
|---|---|
| **Pressure** | A steady squeeze that holds until you release it |
| **Vibration** | An oscillation — buzzing, tapping or pulsing depending on frequency |

**Set the levels**, then press **Trigger**. Press **Release** to vent.

Nothing switches itself off. A channel you triggered stays inflated until you
release it, close the app, or hit the panic control below.

### The settings, and what they actually change

**Intensity** (0.1 – 1.0) is how hard it squeezes. The app shows you the real
target next to the slider, in kPa. Below 15 kPa the glove treats a channel as
off, and it will not go above 50 kPa — so the useful range really is that
slider, end to end.

**Ramp speed** (pressure mode) is how fast it gets there, not how hard. At 1.0
it snaps; at 0.1 it swells slowly. Two very different sensations at the same
intensity — worth trying before you decide a preset feels wrong.

**Frequency** (vibration mode) is the one that changes the *character* of the
sensation, and there is a hard boundary in the hardware at **5 Hz**:

| Frequency | What the glove does | What it feels like |
|---|---|---|
| Under 5 Hz | Pulses the air pressure itself | Slow, deep, physical — a heartbeat or a knock |
| 5 Hz and above | Drives the channel's motor directly | Fast buzz — texture, alerts, engine hum |

These are two different mechanisms, not one scale. The app tells you which one
is running underneath the frequency slider. If a vibration setting feels
nothing like you expected, check which side of 5 Hz you are on.

**Peak ratio** (vibration mode, 0.2 – 0.8) is how much of each cycle is "on".
Low is a short sharp tick; high is a longer swell. This is what separates a tap
from a throb at the same frequency.

### Feeling effects quickly

Some starting points worth trying with the glove on:

| To feel | Mode | Settings |
|---|---|---|
| Gripping a solid object | Pressure | All channels, intensity 1.0, speed 1.0 |
| Something soft giving way | Pressure | All channels, intensity 0.4, speed 0.15 |
| A heartbeat | Vibration | Palm, ~1 Hz, intensity 0.7, peak ratio 0.35 |
| A light tap on one finger | Vibration | Index, ~3 Hz, intensity 0.5, peak ratio 0.2 |
| Texture / roughness | Vibration | Fingertips, 20–30 Hz, intensity 0.5 |
| A buzzing alert | Vibration | All, 35 Hz, intensity 1.0, peak ratio 0.6 |

> **Named effect presets — heartbeat, fountain, raindrops — are not in this
> version.** They exist in the Unity package as authored effects. This app
> gives you the raw controls those effects are built from, so you can dial in
> something close by hand.

### The live monitor

The right-hand panel shows what the glove is reporting: pressure per channel,
battery, and the source pressure feeding all of it.

**If those readings stay empty, that is not a fault.** Some gloves stream
telemetry and some do not, and haptics work either way. It only matters for the
Quick test, which needs the readings to measure anything.

## 03 · Quick test

The pass/fail check. Use it on a glove coming off the bench, or one back from a
customer.

**Take the glove off first.** It drives all six channels to full at once.

Press **Run quick test**. It vents everything, drives all six channels hard for
two seconds, and reports what each one reached:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Perfect** | Above 45 kPa — full strength |
| **Good** | Above 40 kPa — within tolerance |
| **Weak** | Reached pressure but not enough — check the indenter and its tubing |
| **Indenter failed** | Essentially nothing — that channel is not working |
| **Pump failed** | The source never developed pressure |

**Pump failed appears on every channel at once**, because it is one fault, not
six. If you see it, the problem is the pump or its supply — do not go replacing
indenters.

*Time to peak* is the other half of the picture. A channel that reaches
pressure but takes much longer than its neighbours usually means a restriction
or a small leak, even when the verdict says it passed.

Quick test needs telemetry. If the glove is not reporting, the app will say so
rather than invent numbers.

## Safety

A haptic glove can hold a finger squeezed. Three ways to stop everything:

- **Escape** — works anywhere in the app
- **All off** — the red button in the top-right corner, on every screen
- **Close the app** — every channel is vented on the way out

Channels are also vented automatically when you disconnect a glove.

If the app is closed or crashes while something is inflated, powering the arm
module off releases it.

## When something is wrong

| What you see | What it means |
|---|---|
| Scan finds nothing | The arm module is off, or out of range. Press and hold the power button. |
| *Bluetooth unavailable* | Your PC's Bluetooth is off or has no adapter — not a glove problem. |
| Connects, then drops | Usually a low battery. Check the light on the module; red means swap the pack. |
| Connects but no pressure readings | Normal on some gloves. Haptics still work; only Quick test is affected. |
| Trigger does nothing | Check a channel is selected, and that the hand you are driving is the one connected. |
| Wrong finger responds | Tell us — that is a channel mapping problem worth knowing about. |
| The connector pushes back | Mismatched sides. Left glove needs the left module. |
| SmartScreen warning on install | Expected — the build is not signed. **More info → Run anyway**. |

Anything the app cannot explain, `tools/probe_glove.py` in the source will dump
exactly what the glove exposes and sends. Run it with the app closed.

## What it does not do

- It does not track your hand. HEXR provides touch; hand tracking comes from a
  headset or an external tracker.
- It does not record or export sessions.
- It does not carry the authored effect presets from the Unity package.
- It is not needed to use HEXR in an application.
