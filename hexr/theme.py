"""Design tokens for the HEXR Window Tester app.

Every colour, size and radius in the app comes from here — the handoff spec is
transcribed once, in one place, so a token change lands everywhere at once.

Two Tkinter realities shape this module:

* Tk sizes fonts in POINTS when the size is positive and PIXELS when negative.
  The design is specified in pixels, so every size here is negative.
* Tk has no letter-spacing. The design's tracked uppercase micro-labels are
  faked by `track()`; see the note there for what that can and cannot do.
