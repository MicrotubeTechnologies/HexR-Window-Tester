"""The model: what gloves exist, what the tester is set to send.

A plain object polled by the UI on its own timer — there is no observer graph.
The BLE thread mutates these fields and the Tk tick reads them, which is safe
because every field here is a single assignment of an immutable value.

Gloves are keyed by hand, not by address, because a HEXR kit has exactly one
left and one right and the two are not interchangeable. Two gloves of the same
hand cannot be driven at once, and keying by hand makes that structural rather
than something the UI has to police.
