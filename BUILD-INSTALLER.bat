REM  HEXR Window Tester - build the installer.  Double-click this file.
REM
REM  Produces exactly one thing to hand out:
REM
REM      Installer\HexR-Window-Tester-Setup.exe
REM
REM  That file is self-contained. The laptop it runs on needs nothing else -
REM  no Python, no developer tools, no Bluetooth driver.
REM
REM  This machine, the one BUILDING it, does need Python and Inno Setup. If
REM  they are missing, this script offers to install them via winget, which
REM  ships with Windows 10 and 11.
REM
REM  Written with goto and subroutines rather than nested if-blocks: cmd
REM  expands variables for an entire block before running any of it, so
REM  "install it, then look for it again" simply does not work inside one.

REM --- 1. Python --------------------------------------------------------------
call :find_python
if defined PY goto :have_python

echo  Python is not installed on this machine, and the build needs it.
echo.

echo.
echo  Python is installed. Windows only picks up a new program's PATH in a
echo  fresh window, so this one has to close.
echo.
echo  Double-click BUILD-INSTALLER.bat again to carry on.

if errorlevel 1 goto :deps_failed

REM --- 2. Icon ----------------------------------------------------------------
REM Regenerated every build, so the shipped icon can never drift from the
REM generator in tools\ - which is the thing anyone would actually edit.
echo  [2/5] Drawing the app icon...
%PY% tools\make_icon.py
if errorlevel 1 goto :fail

REM --- 3. The app -------------------------------------------------------------
echo  [3/5] Building the app. This is the slow part, around a minute...

REM --- 4. Inno Setup ----------------------------------------------------------
call :find_iscc
if defined ISCC goto :have_iscc

echo.
echo  Inno Setup is missing. It is the free tool that wraps the app up into a
echo  setup .exe, and it is only ever needed on this machine.

REM --- 5. Portable copy -------------------------------------------------------
REM Kept out of Installer\ on purpose. That folder is what gets handed to
REM someone, and it should hold one file with one obvious name. The zip is for
REM locked-down machines that cannot run an installer at all.
echo  [5/5] Zipping a portable copy for locked-down machines...

echo  ======================================================
echo   Done.
echo.
echo   Send people this one file:
echo       Installer\HexR-Window-Tester-Setup.exe
echo.
echo   They double-click it and get a HEXR Window Tester icon
echo   on their desktop. Nothing else to install.
echo.
echo   dist\HexR-Window-Tester-portable.zip is the no-install
echo   copy, for machines that block installers.
