/**
 * Canned state for the Play Store screenshots.
 *
 * Every screen in this app is a view onto a glove, so on a machine with no
 * glove — an emulator, or any phone without the hardware to hand — there is
 * nothing to photograph: an empty scan list, dashes for every pressure, no
 * verdicts. These scenarios stand in for the hardware long enough to take a
 * picture.
 *
 * It is reachable only from a debuggable build, and only when asked for by
 * name on the launch intent:
 *
 *     adb shell am start -n com.microtube.hexr.tester.debug/com.microtube.hexr.MainActivity \
 *         --es demo driving
 *
 * There is no path to it from the UI and none at all from a release build —
 * see the guard in MainActivity.onCreate. It is data, not a mode: the numbers
 * below are handed to the ordinary [Glove] objects and the ordinary tick turns
 * them into the ordinary snapshots, so what ends up on screen is the real UI
 * reading a real model. Nothing is drawn specially for the store.
 *
 * The values are plausible readings from a healthy kit, chosen to match the
 * verdict bands in [QuickTest]. They are fixed rather than jittered so a
 * screenshot can be retaken and come out the same.
