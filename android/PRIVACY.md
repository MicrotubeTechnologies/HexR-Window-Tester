# Privacy policy — HEXR Tester for Android

Google Play requires a privacy policy at a public URL before an app can be
published, even one that collects nothing. This is the source text; the
published copy is `docs/privacy.html`, served by GitHub Pages at

    https://microtubetechnologies.github.io/HexR-Window-Tester/privacy.html

The two are maintained by hand and must be edited together. Have whoever signs
off on company copy read this before the first submission — in particular the
contact address, which is currently the repository's issue tracker rather than a
company mailbox.

HEXR Tester is a diagnostic tool for HEXR pneumatic gloves, used by technicians
to drive a glove's channels and read back its sensors over Bluetooth.

## What it collects

Nothing.

The app has no user accounts, no analytics, no crash reporting and no
advertising. It does not read contacts, photos, files, or the device's location.

## What it sends

Nothing.

The app declares no internet permission, so the operating system will not let it
open a network connection even if it tried to. Everything it does happens
between the phone and a glove over Bluetooth LE, on the bench in front of you.

## What it stores

Test results exist only while the app is open, in memory. Closing it discards
them. Nothing is written to storage and nothing is backed up — the app sets
`allowBackup="false"`.

## Bluetooth and location permissions

On Android 12 and newer the app asks for *Nearby devices*, to find and connect
to gloves. The Bluetooth scan is declared `neverForLocation`, meaning the app
tells Android it will not use scan results to work out where you are — so
Android does not ask you for location access, and the app never receives it.

On Android 11 and older the app requests location permission instead. That is
not a change in what it does: before Android 12 there were no dedicated
Bluetooth permissions, and location was the only way the platform allowed a
Bluetooth scan at all. The app still only reads the advertised name of nearby
gloves.

## Children

The app is a workshop tool and is not directed at children.

## Changes

Any change to this policy will be published at this URL, with the date above
updated.

A monitored company address would be better here, and should replace this before
the listing goes to production. The issue tracker is public, is read, and is a
real channel — which is what Play requires — but it is not what a customer
expects to find on a privacy policy.
