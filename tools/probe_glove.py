"""Diagnostic: what does the glove actually expose, and what does it send?

Run this when the app says "Connected · no telemetry" — it answers the three
questions that state can mean, in order:

  1. Is the characteristic we subscribe to the one that actually notifies?
  2. Does subscribing alone start the stream, or does the glove need a poke?
  3. Are frames arriving but failing to decode?

    python tools/probe_glove.py                 # scan, pick the first glove
    python tools/probe_glove.py --hand Left
    python tools/probe_glove.py --address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
    python tools/probe_glove.py --seconds 20

Close HEXR Window Tester first. A BLE peripheral generally accepts one connection,
so the app holding the glove is itself a reason a second connect sees nothing.
